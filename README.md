## Use/Navigation:
*NEW* Added VR Support for Oculus Rift. Needs Firefox VR or Chromium Browser.

Wave supports 3D navigation by the Leap Motion controller.

If you don't have a Leap, then use the following keyboard commands:

- WASD for going forward, leftward, backward, and rightward.
- IJKL for turning up, left, down, and right.
- QE for going down, up.
- UO for rolling left, right.

## Todo:

- search item while in VR mode
- frontend support for article pictures
- remove citation links from results
- handle ambiguous targets
